# Security Fixes for Practice Test System

## Critical Security Issues Fixed

### 1. Data Leakage in Practice Test Access
**Issue**: Students could see ALL practice tests regardless of batch assignment
**Fix**: 
- Implemented strict batch-based access control
- Users can only see tests assigned to their active batches
- Users not in batches can only see public tests
- Removed question data exposure in test listings

### 2. Debug Endpoint Vulnerability
**Issue**: Debug endpoint exposed all test data to any authenticated user
**Fix**: 
- Removed `debugUserBatchTests` endpoint completely
- Removed corresponding route from `practiceTest.routes.js`

### 3. Insufficient Access Control
**Issue**: No proper batch membership validation
**Fix**: 
- Created `batchAccess.middleware.js` with `validateBatchAccess` function
- Added batch membership validation for all test operations
- Implemented proper user type validation

### 4. Missing Rate Limiting
**Issue**: No protection against brute force attacks
**Fix**: 
- Added `rateLimit.middleware.js` with different limits for different operations
- Practice test operations: 50 requests per 15 minutes
- Test submissions: 10 requests per 5 minutes
- Authentication: 5 attempts per 15 minutes

### 5. Lack of Security Logging
**Issue**: No monitoring of security events
**Fix**: 
- Added `securityLogging.middleware.js`
- Logs authentication failures, authorization failures, rate limit violations
- Logs practice test access and submission attempts

## New Security Middleware

### batchAccess.middleware.js
- `validateBatchAccess`: Ensures users can only access tests assigned to their batches
- `validateBatchMembership`: Validates batch membership for batch operations

### rateLimit.middleware.js
- `practiceTestRateLimit`: General rate limiting for practice test operations
- `testSubmissionRateLimit`: Stricter rate limiting for test submissions
- `authRateLimit`: Rate limiting for authentication endpoints

### securityLogging.middleware.js
- Logs all security-relevant events
- Monitors failed authentication attempts
- Tracks authorization failures
- Records rate limit violations

## Updated Controllers

### practiceTest.controller.js
- **getAvailablePracticeTests**: Complete rewrite with proper security
  - Only shows tests assigned to user's batches
  - Removes question data from test listings
  - Validates user type and batch membership
  - Removes debug logging in production

- **startPracticeTest**: Simplified batch access check
  - Relies on middleware for batch validation
  - Removes redundant security checks

## Updated Routes

### practiceTest.routes.js
- Added rate limiting to all practice test routes
- Added batch access validation to test start endpoint
- Removed debug endpoint route

### batch.routes.js
- Added rate limiting and batch membership validation

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only see what they need
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security validation
3. **Input Validation**: Proper validation of user types and batch assignments
4. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and brute force attacks
5. **Security Logging**: Comprehensive monitoring of security events
6. **Data Minimization**: Only expose necessary data to frontend

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test that users can only see tests assigned to their batches
2. Test that users not in batches can only see public tests
3. Test rate limiting functionality
4. Test security logging
5. Test batch access validation middleware
6. Verify no question data is exposed in test listings

## Monitoring

Monitor the following security events:
- Failed authentication attempts (401 responses)
- Authorization failures (403 responses)
- Rate limit violations (429 responses)
- Practice test access patterns
- Test submission patterns

## Future Security Enhancements

1. Add IP-based blocking for repeated violations
2. Implement CAPTCHA for suspicious activity
3. Add request fingerprinting
4. Implement session management improvements
5. Add audit trail for all test operations
